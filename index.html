    <p>Hi, my name is Kaitlyn</p>
    <p>
      I started studying digital media because I wanted to understand how the
      things I enjoy online are actually made, and maybe make my own one day
    </p>
    <p>I spend a lot of time daydreaming</p>
    <p>My favourite emoji is : ૮꒰˶- ˕ -꒱ა</p>
    <p>
      My personal experience with sound is mostly just listening to music a lot
      and messing with playlists<!-- elaborate as much as you like -->
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a little prior experience working with code - just basic stuff like
      HTML and CSS when I wanted to customize things<!-- elaborate as much as you like -->
    </p>
